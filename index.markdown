#Henrik's Projects

## Public Sites
* [BulletinApp.com](http://BulletinApp.com) - This site lets churches have their own iPhone App. It's written in Django and use jQTouch to create a nice web-based smartphone front-end.

* [RecipeBin](http://www.RecipeBinApp.com) - This project lets you store your recipes in the cloud. It runs on Google App Engine and doesn't require any signup. Just log in with your Google account and start adding recipes. For a full run-down of the technology used and some of the reasons for building it [read my blog post about it](http://joreteg.com/post/236837591/recipebin-new-iphone-recipe-app).

## jQuery Plugins
* [jQuery Sliding Message Plugin](/jquery-sliding-message) - This plugin provides a cool way to temporarily display messages to the user. They slide into view from the top or bottom of the screen and then slide out of view and you can easily customize it for whatever you want.

* [jQuery Magic Labels Plugin](/jquery-magic-labels) - This is a plugin makes it easy to create text inputs with placeholder text instead of labels. It does this by taking the text from the associated `<label>` tags and displaying it in your `<input type="text">` fields and `<textarea>`'s. It keeps your markup semantic and follows progressive enhancement priciples while giving you the benefit of saving space for small forms etc.

## Small Experiments Etc.
* [Polar Clock written in JavaScript using Canvas](/Polar-Clock-Canvas) - I wrote an imitation of my favorite screen saver the Polar Clock by Pixel Breaker using JavaScript and the canvas tag.

* [InspiredToTweet.com](http://InspiredToTweet.com) - Weekend project trying to squeeze display and behavior into a single flat html file. This grabs and displays tweets where people talk about inspiration.

* [Tzee](/Tzee) - This is a simple Yahtzee score-keeping app written in JavaScript, just for fun. I was just curious how hard it would be. I got it to a working state, I may style it for an iPhone since it requires very minimal text input.

## Older Stuff

* [HouseFLIX.com](http://www.houseflix.com) - HouseFLIX was my first real web app that I built from scratch. Started this business right before the real estate market collapse. Still operated by the videographer who bought the business.

<h1>Henrik's Projects</h1>
<p>First of all, this project page is a project in itself. I'll add stuff here and start dressing it up a bit. But here my raw nerdiness is on display.</p>

<ul>
    <h2>In Progress Stuff</h2>
    <li>
        <p><a href="/Tzee">Tzee</a> - This is a simple Yahtzee score-keeping app written in JavaScript, just for fun. I was just curious how hard it would be. I got it to a working state, I may style it for an iPhone since it requires very minimal text input.</p>
    </li>
    
    <h2>Semi-Completed Stuff</h2>
    <li>
        <p><a href="/jquery-magic-labels">jQuery Magic Labels Plugin</a> - This is a plugin for jQuery that makes it easy to create text inputs with placeholder text instead of labels. It does this by taking the text from the associated <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tags and displaying it in your <code>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code> fields and <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>'s. It keeps your markup semantic and follows progressive enhancement priciples while giving you the benefit of saving space for small forms etc.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a href="http://InspiredToTweet.com">InspiredToTweet.com</a> - Weekend project trying to squeeze display and behavior into a single flat html file. This grabs and displays tweets where people talk about inspiration.</p>
    </li>
    
    <h2>Older Stuff</h2>
    <li>
        <p><a href="http://www.houseflix.com">HouseFLIX.com</a> - HouseFLIX was my first real web app that I built from scratch. Started this business right before the real estate market collapse. Still operated by the videographer who bought the business.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

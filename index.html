<h1>Henrik's Projects</h1>
<p>First of all, this project page is a project in itself. I'll add stuff here and start dressing it up a bit. But here my raw nerdiness is on display.</p>

<ul>
    <h2>In Progress Stuff</h2>
    <li><p><a href="http://www.RecipeBinApp.com">RecipeBin</a> - This project lets you store your recipes in the cloud. It runs on Google App Engine and doesn't require any signup. Just log in with your Google account and start adding recipes. For a full run-down of the technology used and some of the reasons for building it <a href="http://joreteg.com/post/236837591/recipebin-new-iphone-recipe-app">read my blog post about it</a>.</p></li>
    <li>
        <p><a href="/Tzee">Tzee</a> - This is a simple Yahtzee score-keeping app written in JavaScript, just for fun. I was just curious how hard it would be. I got it to a working state, I may style it for an iPhone since it requires very minimal text input.</p>
    </li>
    
    <h2>Semi-Completed Stuff</h2>
    <li>
        <p><a href="/Polar-Clock-Canvas">Polar Clock written in JavaScript using Canvas</a> - I wrote an imitation of my favorite screen saver the Polar Clock by Pixel Breaker using JavaScript and the canvas tag.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a href="/jquery-magic-labels">jQuery Magic Labels Plugin</a> - This is a plugin for jQuery that makes it easy to create text inputs with placeholder text instead of labels. It does this by taking the text from the associated <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tags and displaying it in your <code>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code> fields and <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>'s. It keeps your markup semantic and follows progressive enhancement priciples while giving you the benefit of saving space for small forms etc.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a href="http://InspiredToTweet.com">InspiredToTweet.com</a> - Weekend project trying to squeeze display and behavior into a single flat html file. This grabs and displays tweets where people talk about inspiration.</p>
    </li>
    
    <h2>Older Stuff</h2>
    <li>
        <p><a href="http://www.houseflix.com">HouseFLIX.com</a> - HouseFLIX was my first real web app that I built from scratch. Started this business right before the real estate market collapse. Still operated by the videographer who bought the business.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
